# CURRENTY IN THE PROJECT.

# This is a number guessing game where the user will enter the upper and lower bound so that he can know upto which number the game will go.
# Here the computer will automatically generate/ pick a number form the given range, and counting will be done here so we can see how many chances were taken by the user to exactly get the output.

# FEATURES THAT WILL BE ADDED.
